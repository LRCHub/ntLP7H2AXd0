Dogs, man
Yeah, For All The Dogs
Mm, oh-oh-oh, ayy-ayy

Hailey, it's sad that I know all the tea
Broken pinky promises, you fucked up our Bahamas trip
I know that you're not for me
Hailey
I'm tired of your apologies
You put the "No" in monogamy (No)
You know that you're not for me
Hailey
I'm slidin' down Black Creek
My friends say they wanna meet, but (I don't have the energy)
But I don't have the energy 'cause, ooh
I'm tired of your apologies
Broken pinky promises, you fucked up my Bahamas trip
I know that you're not for me, Hailey
You're livin' in my mind for free
And for someone you don't miss, I sure feel like somebody you need
Hailey
You ain't got nowhere to be
It's 'cause you should've been with me
The list of things we could've been
Damn
Guess I'll see you in my dreams
I'm fucked up off of T3
Promise I won't cause a scene
I got too much respect for me

Dogs, man
Yeah, For All The Dogs
